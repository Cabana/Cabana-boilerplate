# Cabana Boilerplate

This is our very neat boilerplate for creating awesome websites.

## How to get setup
If you already have all dependencies setup and configured the simply run `git clone https://github.com/Cabana/Cabana-boilerplate.git` from the command line to get started.

However if you don't follow these steps.

**1. Git**
If you're on Windows you can either use the [GitHub GUI app for windows](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) or look at the [git webite](http://git-scm.com/) for how to install the binary.

If you're on a Mac we suggest you install [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) and then install git with `brew install git`.

**2. Ruby**
If you're Windows go to [rubyinstall.org](http://rubyinstaller.org/) and follow the steps there.

If you're on a Mac you will need to install rvm. A good guide can be found [here](http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/).

You should be on Ruby version 2.0.0 or later when you're done.

**3. Clone down the boilerplate**
Then Git and Ruby have been setup you should be able to clone down the repo with `git clone https://github.com/Cabana/Cabana-boilerplate.git`.

**4. Install gem dependencies**
Make sure [bundler](http://gembundler.com/) is installed with `gem install bundler`. Then from within the root of the project run `bundle install` to install gem dependencies.
